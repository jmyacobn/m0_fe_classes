# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

These were extremely difficult, and I felt like giving up multiple times. This task more than any other required me to seek out support from others. After completing the other CFUs this week, I felt as though I was nearing proficiency. With this one, while I got every single one to run properly, I am still trying to piece together how I got there. I would say with this one, I need to spend more time with it and processing it after stepping away. I feel extremely proud of myself for figuring out the Big Challenge with the Hobbit, although I would never have gotten there without my small group team.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

I am spending entirely too much time with all the lessons and CFUs. I think that I need to take more frequent breaks so that I do not continue to get stuck. Surprisingly, my focus has been better than I anticipated.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

I need to continue to work on my mindset so that I do not hit those moments where I revert to negative self-talk and telling myself that maybe I do not belong here. This is untrue and unproductive thinking. Every day in my math classroom, I intentionally worked to cultivate a growth mindset in my students, and I need to do the same for myself. Perhaps, I should pull out some of the strategies that I used with them (i.e. visualization, weekly check-ins, "I am" statements, etc.)
